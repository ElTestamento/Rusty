Sand Simulation (Rust)

Small experimental project to explore grid-based particle simulation.

The primary goal of this project is to learn Rust in a **project-oriented way** as a low-level complement to Python. 
While Python is my main language for machine learning and rapid prototyping, it is not well suited for performance-critical, real-time, or systems-level tasks.

This repository therefore focuses on:
- learning Rust as a **low-level systems language**
- exploring **performance-oriented design** (memory layout, cache locality, data-oriented structures)
- implementing **simple physics rules** on a grid-based particle system
- building intuition for **simulation, robotics, and game-related workloads**

Status: exploratory / learning project.
